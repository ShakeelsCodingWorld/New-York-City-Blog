🗽 New York City – HTML Project
Hi there! This is a simple HTML-only webpage I created to showcase my understanding of semantic HTML, multimedia integration, and web structure. It’s designed to give a mini virtual tour of New York City, including its history, food, and scenery.

This project was part of my learning journey in front-end web development, and it highlights how HTML elements can work together to create structured, meaningful, and accessible content.

📚 What This Project Includes
🔗 Navigation Bar
I used a nav element to create a navigation menu that lets users jump to different sections of the page:

Blog

Media

About

Each link uses an anchor (#id) to scroll to the corresponding section of the page.

📰 Blog Section
This section uses:

A section tag with an ID for linking

An article to contain a short write-up about NYC, including history and famous places

🖼️ Figure & Image
I added an image of the Statue of Liberty using the figure and figcaption elements.

This structure helps with accessibility and improves the semantic clarity of the page.

🍕 Aside Section
A aside element holds fun facts about NYC food.

I used an ordered list 'ol' element to present the top food items, such as pizza and bagels.

🎥 Media Section
I demonstrated the use of multimedia by embedding:

A video showing the NYC skyline

An image using the embed tag

An audio clip with the ambient sounds of the city

This shows how to integrate different media formats into a webpage using basic HTML elements.

📩 Footer
The footer provides contact information and the author’s name.
It’s also linked with the "About" section for smooth page navigation.

🧠 What I Learned
Semantic HTML: Using proper tags like nav, main, section, article, aside, and footer helps with page structure, accessibility, and SEO.

Multimedia Integration: I learned how to embed videos, audio, and images directly in a webpage without JavaScript.

Anchor Links: I practiced linking different parts of a page using IDs and anchor tags.

Page Structure: I gained confidence in organizing content in a way that’s easy to read and navigate.

✅ Skills Demonstrated
HTML5 page layout

Semantic HTML elements

Embedding media (video, audio, images)

Internal navigation with anchor links

Accessibility awareness (using alt and <figcaption>)
